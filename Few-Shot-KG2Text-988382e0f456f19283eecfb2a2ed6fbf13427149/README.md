# Datasets and Models
Our processed KG-to-Text datasets, including WebNLG, Agenda and GenWiki-Fine, can be downloaded from [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h6aJsfTJbniKtaja_ML-DyjQT1A5NUmK?usp=sharing). Specifically, we choose the three largest domains, i.e., Food, Airport, and Building, from WebNLG, and two largest domains, i.e., Sports and Games, from GenWiki-Fine. Their original datasets can be downloaded from [WebNLG](https://webnlg-challenge.loria.fr/challenge_2017/), [Agenda](https://github.com/rikdz/GraphWriter), and [Genwiki](https://github.com/zhijing-jin/genwiki). The WebNLG dataset is made of xml files, you can refer to [this repository](https://github.com/zhijing-jin/WebNLG_Reader) to transform them into json files. We utilize the large version of BART from Hugging Face.

# Training Instructions

Before implement our code, you need to pre-process each dataset (train.json, valid.json, and test.json), and build vocabulary and initilized node embeddings:

```
python process.py
python build_vocab.py
python build_embedding.py
```

After preparing all the files, you can run the run.sh file to start training by setting ```mode: train``` in config.yaml.

```
sh run.sh 
```

# Testing Instructions

At the test stage, you can run the run.sh file to start testing by setting ```mode: test``` in config.yaml.
